An island is a small piece of land surrounded by water. 
A group of islands is said to be connected if we can reach from any given island to any other island in the same group. 
Given V islands (numbered from 0 to V-1) and E connections or edges between islands. Can you count the number of connected groups of islands.

Sample Input 1:
5 8
0 1
0 4
1 2
2 0
2 4
3 0
3 2
4 3
Sample Output 1:
1 

Solution of Problem :-

public class Solution {
    
    private static int numConnectedDFS(int[][] edges, int currVertex, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[currVertex] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
            if (edges[currVertex][i] == 1 && !visited[i]) {
                numConnectedDFS(edges, i, visited);
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }

	public static int numConnected(int[][] edges, int n) {
        if(n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        boolean visited[] = new boolean[n];
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int getCount = numConnectedDFS(edges, i, visited);
                count += getCount;
            }
        }
        return count;
	}
}
